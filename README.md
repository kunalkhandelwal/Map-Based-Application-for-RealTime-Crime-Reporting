# Map-Based-Application-for-RealTime-Crime-Reporting

A Mobile application programming based Application for real time crime reporting. 

Most of the times what happens is that we see people committing crimes but don't know how to report them. Sometimes the emergency helpline numbers are not effective enough and hence, we have created an app for the users to report crimes and maybe register FIRs with the collaboration of the regional police. 

We have developed an app for the user side, a website for the police side and the data that is in the form of image/video/text could be uploaded on our app and that would simultaneously be visible on the website that would be accessible by the police.

Prog Languages/Technologies used in the project: 

Application : Flutter

Website: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP

Database: Google Firebase
